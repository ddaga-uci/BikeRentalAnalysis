# BikeRentalAnalysis
Analyzing bike rental sales data

Purpose
Build a regression model to predict hourly bike rentals.

Data Set
Bike sharing systems are a relatively new generation of traditional bike rentals where whole process from membership, rental and return is automatic. Through these systems, the user rents a bike from a certain position and return it at another position. Currently, there are about over 500 bike-sharing programs around the world which is composed of over 500,000 bicycles.

The characteristics of data being generated by these systems make them attractive.  As opposed to other transport services. such as bus or subway, the duration of travel, departure and arrival position is explicitly recorded in these systems. This feature turns bike sharing system into a virtual sensor network that can be used for sensing mobility in the city. Hence, it is expected that most of important events in the city could be detected via monitoring these data.

The data is hourly data over two years. This data was obtained from:

The data set has been modified slightly from the original. The goal is to predict the total number of rentals each hour, “cnt”.
